# Viewing History and Diffs

jj provides powerful tools for exploring history and comparing changes.

## Viewing History

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
git log
commit abc123 (HEAD -> main)
Author: user <email>
Date: Mon Jan 22 10:00:00 2024

    Add feature

commit def456
Author: user <email>
Date: Sun Jan 21 15:30:00 2024

    Initial commit
```

**jj:**
```bash
jj log
@  pqrs feature-auth
◉  mnop Add feature
◉  ijkl Initial commit
```
</SideBySide>

## Log Options

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
# Compact view
git log --oneline

# Limit entries
git log -n 10

# Show graph
git log --graph --oneline
```

**jj:**
```bash
# Limit entries
jj log -l 10

# Show with graph
jj log --graph

# Show all revisions
jj log --all
```
</SideBySide>

## Understanding the Log Output

In jj's log:
- `@` = Your working copy commit
- `◉` = Regular commits
- `◌` = Abandoned commits
- `@` appears in the log as the latest commit

```bash
$ jj log
@  xyzkpznx test 123
◉  prklqyso test foo
◉  roqmyuqs test bar
◉  yostqsxx qux
```

## Viewing Commit Details

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
git show HEAD
commit abc123...
Author: user <email>
Date: Mon Jan 22 10:00:00

    Add feature

diff --git a/app.js b/app.js
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..abc123
--- /dev/null
+++ b/app.js
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+console.log('hello');
```

**jj:**
```bash
jj show @
commit xyzkpznx
parents: prklqyso
test 123

Added files:
  app.js

Modified files:
  index.js

Diff:
```
</SideBySide>

## Viewing Diffs

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
# Working copy vs HEAD
git diff

# File vs HEAD
git diff app.js

# Between commits
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
```

**jj:**
```bash
# @ vs parent
jj diff

# Specific file
jj diff app.js

# Between commits
jj diff --from @- --to @
```
</SideBySide>

## Diff Syntax

jj uses `--from` and `--to` for precise diff control:

```bash
# Compare @ with parent
jj diff --from @- --to @

# Compare two commits
jj diff --from abc --to def

# Compare with main
jj diff --from main --to @

# See what changed since main
jj diff --from main
```

## Common Diff Patterns

**What changed in my working copy?**
```bash
jj diff
```

**What's different between two branches?**
```bash
jj diff --from main --to feature
```

**Show me the changes in this commit:**
```bash
jj show abc
# or
jj diff --from abc^- --to abc
```

**What files are modified?**
```bash
jj status
```

## The Status Command

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   app.js
  modified:   lib.js

Untracked files:
  new.js
```

**jj:**
```bash
$ jj status
Working copy : @
Parent commit: pqrsmnop

Committing a will create the following commit:
  M app.js
  M lib.js
  A new.js

Working copy changes:
  M app.js
  M lib.js
  A new.js
```
</SideBySide>

## Interactive History

jj's log is more than just text—it's an interactive history:

```bash
# View log with more details
jj log -v

# Show change IDs
jj log --change-id

# Show commit timestamps
jj log --timestamps
```

## Comparing Files

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
git diff HEAD app.js
git diff branch1 branch2 app.js
```

**jj:**
```bash
jj diff app.js
jj diff --from branch1 --to branch2 app.js
```
</SideBySide>

## Operations Log

jj maintains an operation log—useful for undoing:

```bash
# Show operation history
jj op log

# Output:
# 0123 minutes ago: checkout
# 0456 minutes ago: new
# 0789 minutes ago: describe
```

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Make some changes
echo "test" > test.txt
echo "demo" > demo.txt

# See what changed
jj diff

# Commit them
jj describe -m "Add files"
jj new

# View the commit
jj show @-

# See history
jj log

# Compare with parent
jj diff --from @- --to @
```

## Key Takeaways

- `jj log` shows commit history with `@` marking working copy
- `jj diff` shows @ vs parent (use `--from/--to` for more)
- `jj show` displays full commit details
- `jj status` shows pending changes
- `jj op log` shows operation history for undo

## Next Steps

Now let's explore how jj handles remote operations differently from git.
