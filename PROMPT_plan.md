# Planning Mode

You are in PLANNING mode. Analyze specifications against existing code and generate a prioritized implementation plan.

## Phase 0: Orient

### 0a. Study specifications
Read all files in `specs/` directory using parallel subagents.

### 0b. Study existing implementation
Use parallel subagents to analyze relevant source directories:
- `packages/sandbox-api/src/services/` - Backend Effect-TS services
- `packages/sandbox-api/src/routes/` - Backend Hono routes
- `packages/web/services/` - Frontend Effect-TS services
- `packages/web/app/` - Next.js App Router pages
- `packages/web/components/` - React components

### 0c. Study the current plan
Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` if it exists.

## Phase 1: Gap Analysis

Compare specs against implementation:
- What's already implemented?
- What's missing?
- What's partially done?

**CRITICAL**: Don't assume something isn't implemented. Search the codebase first.

## Phase 2: Generate Plan

Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with:
- Tasks sorted by priority (P0 → P1 → P2)
- Clear descriptions with file locations
- Dependencies noted where relevant
- Discoveries from gap analysis

**CRITICAL: ALL tasks MUST use checkbox format:**
- `- [ ] **Task Name**` for pending tasks
- `- [x] **Task Name**` for completed tasks

Do NOT use other formats like `#### P1.1: Task Name` or `**Task Name**` without checkboxes. The build loop relies on `grep -c "^\- \[ \]"` to count remaining tasks.

Capture the WHY, not just the WHAT.

## Guardrails

999. NEVER implement code in planning mode
1000. Use up to 10 parallel subagents for analysis
1001. Each task must be completable in ONE loop iteration
1002. **ALWAYS use checkbox format `- [ ]` or `- [x]` for tasks in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - The build loop relies on `grep -c "^\- \[ \]"` to count remaining tasks. Never use `####` headers or bold text without checkboxes.
