# Undo and Time Travel

jj's operation log makes it impossible to lose work—every action is recorded and reversible.

## The Operation Log

Every jj command is recorded in the operation log:

```bash
$ jj op log
d5f3b08fe3ea5  2 minutes ago  checkout
1c8e94a3f2c1b  4 minutes ago  new
e7d3a0b5d4c2e  6 minutes ago  describe
a2b5c8d9e0f1a  8 minutes ago  checkout
```

Compare to git's reflog:

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
$ git reflog
abc123 HEAD@{0}: commit: Add feature
def456 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from main to feature
# Expires after 90 days by default
```

**jj:**
```bash
$ jj op log
xyz@ 2 minutes ago: checkout
abc@ 4 minutes ago: new
# Never expires, full history
```
</SideBySide>

## Undoing Operations

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
# Oops, committed to wrong branch
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
# Hope reflog hasn't expired
```

**jj:**
```bash
# Oops, committed to wrong place
jj op undo
# Instant, safe, always works
```
</SideBySide>

## Multiple Undos

```bash
# Undo last 3 operations
jj op undo --count 3
```

## Restoring Specific States

<SideBySide>
**Git:**
```bash
# Reset to specific reflog entry
git reset --hard HEAD@{5}
```

**jj:**
```bash
# Restore to specific operation
jj op restore abc123
```
</SideBySide>

## Viewing Past States

You can view the repository as it was at any operation:

```bash
# Show log at past operation
jj op log -at <operation-id>

# Show status at past operation
jj op show <operation-id>
```

## Common Undo Scenarios

**Accidentally abandoned work:**
```bash
# Oops, abandoned wrong commit
jj abandon @-

# Undo it
jj op undo

# Commit is back
jj log
```

**Bad rebase:**
```bash
# Rebase went wrong
jj rebase -d bad-base

# Undo entire rebase
jj op undo
```

**Mistaken merge:**
```bash
# Merged wrong branch
jj merge wrong-branch

# Undo
jj op undo
```

## Time Travel Debugging

The operation log is like a time machine:

```bash
# Something broke, when did it happen?
jj op log

# Jump back to before it broke
jj op restore <good-operation-id>

# Verify bug isn't there
jj log
jj show @

# Come back to present
jj op restore <latest-operation-id>
```

## Comparing States

```bash
# Compare current state with past
jj diff --from <past-operation>

# See what changed between two operations
jj diff --from <op1> --to <op2>
```

## Operation IDs vs Commit IDs

- **Operation ID**: Identifies a command in the operation log
- **Commit ID**: Identifies a specific commit
- **Change ID**: Stable identifier for a logical change

```bash
# Undo an operation (sequence of commits)
jj op undo <operation-id>

# View a specific commit
jj show <commit-id>

# Track a change across rebases
jj log -r change(<change-id>)
```

## Immutable Operations

Some operations can't be undone (for safety):

```bash
jj git push  # Pushed to remote—can't undo
jj git fetch # Fetched from remote—can't undo
```

But you can undo their local effects:

```bash
# After a problematic fetch
jj git fetch
jj op undo  # Undoes the local ref updates
```

## Practical Workflow

```bash
# Experiment freely
jj new
echo "radical change" > core.js
jj describe -m "Experiment"
jj new

# Doesn't work out
jj op undo

# Try different approach
jj new
echo "conservative change" > core.js
jj describe -m "Safe refactor"
jj new
```

## Operation Log Size

The operation log grows but jj handles it efficiently:

```bash
# Operations are cheap
# Thousands of operations = still fast

# Clean old operations if needed
jj op log --limit 100
```

## Git Comparison Summary

| Task | Git | jj |
|------|-----|----|
| Undo last action | `git reset --hard HEAD@{1}` | `jj op undo` |
| View history | `git reflog` | `jj op log` |
| Restore state | `git reset --hard <ref>` | `jj op restore <id>` |
| Undo multiple | Complex git dancing | `jj op undo --count N` |
| Time limit | 90 days default | Never expires |

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Make some changes
echo "a" > a.txt
jj describe -m "Add A"
jj new

echo "b" > b.txt
jj describe -m "Add B"
jj new

# Undo last operation
jj op undo
# b.txt is gone

# Undo again
jj op undo
# a.txt is gone

# Redo by going forward
jj op log  # Find the operations
jj op restore <id>  # Jump to any point
```

## Key Takeaways

- Every jj operation is recorded
- `jj op undo` reverses the last operation
- `jj op restore` jumps to any past state
- Operation log never expires
- Safe experimentation—always can undo
- More reliable than git reflog
